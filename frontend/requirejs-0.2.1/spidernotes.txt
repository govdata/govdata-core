- jquery/jqueryDynamic2.html in IE8: sometimes if using cache, the jquery ready callbacks do not fire,
  even though we seem to indicate it correctly? Trace latest jQuery 1.4.4.
- check circular dep test in safari, commonjs tests too.
- See if the exclude pragmas still make sense.

- Support npm paths?
- 

1) In HTML, doing a require(["app"], function () {}),

the function will only be called if app.js uses define() to define itself vs. require.

2) No require.modify
- REMOVED from the docs!

3) No more pause/resume calls.

4) nameToUrl is different than toUrl, and toUrl *requires* the use of module
   names, cannot be optionally urls like what nameToUrl supports?

5) Support ifdef! plugin?

6) Pass config object to plugins? require.mixin, require.attach..

7) Remove doc notes to Transport D, transportD
