'''
Intercept system i/o functions and analyze stack that made i/o calls. 

One of the main purposes of the Data Environment to understand 
and manage data dependencies.  At a basic level, these data 
dependencies involve reading and writing files to disk.  To this end, 
it is useful to be able to determine exactly which files are being read 
and written, realtime -- by during processes of individual users doing 
exploratory data analysis as well as by automatic system updates.  
One wants not only to know which i/o streams are being started, but
also which high-level processes and functions are doing the reading and writing.    

This module provides routines for:
	1) intercepting i/o streams at a low level
	2) analyzing the call stack above those streams
	3) integrating the information from 1 and 2 to:
		-- store data about which files were read/written, and 
		therefore enable run-time determination of _undeclared_ 
		data dependency links
	and 
		-- impose controls on which files can be written by which 
		processes, thereby enabling the enforcement of _declared_ 
		data dependency links. 
	
The idea behind the imposition of controls is not to give the Data Enviroment 
an account security interface whereby Data Environment users can be 
flexibly prevented by Data Environment administrators from doing things
with files that don't belong to them. (Such things are probably better 
administered at the operating system level by real user accounts.)  
Instead, the idea is to allow the users to impose controls on themselves 
so that they, and others using their data, can be assured that the 
LinkLists that the Data Environment builds from the users' declarations
are an accurate reflection of the way the data was actually produced 
-- and have errors raised when dependency violations occur.  This allows 
users to easily see where they've forgotten to declare dependencies properly, 
and trivially know how to remedy the issue. 

The majority of the routines in this file are the system i/o intercepts themselves.  
The idea in each case is to implement for a standard i/o function, the
following three-step "redefinition" procedure: 
	1) take the standard __builtin__ I/O functions and save it to a "hold name" 
		(e.g. by prefixing "old_" to the name)
	2) redefine a new i/o function with PRECISELY the same interface as 
		the old one, and whichn calls the function at the "holding name" after
		first having passed the inputs and outputs through an I/O interception 
		and check that uses information from the GetDependsCreates() call 
		stack analyzer function. 
	3) redefine the system's standard I/O name as the new i/o function.
	
Step 2) can either implement:
	a) a "control" -- meaning that an i/o function that is called without being 
		covered by a declared dependency will raise a "BadCheckError" that
		prevents the I/O operation from occuring and prints information about the 
		violation, 
or 
	b) a "logging" operation -- meaning that data about the i/o request, together 
		with the stack inforamtion about where it was made and whether it was
		consistent with declarations -- is stored in some standard format and place.
-- and of course, it can do both.  

The slightly complex 3-step redefinition procedure is used to prevent 
problematic infinite recursions.  It also must be handled with care because,
once these intercepts are activated, ALL calls to these system functions 
will be passed through the intercepts.   This means that:
	-- protections can't be set too widely,
	-- interfaces of the functions must be preversed EXACTLY,
so that programs indirected called by the user as dependencies to 
other functions, and that require resources "outside" the system, are 
not bizarrely restricted from performing their work. (This is especially 
the case for automatic logging and other interactive features of enhanced 
python shells like iPython, which I tend to want to use.)

		If 'SystemMode' environment variable is set at 'Exploratory',

	to read and write whatever is desired in working Temp directory. 
		
	Probably a more flexible and less hard-coded way of allowing the
