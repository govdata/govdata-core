How To Set Up Apache 2.2 Virtual Hosting and Running CGI Scripts:


OS X:

1) edit /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf:
	a) change User to account USERNAME, around line 141
	b) uncomment line about including virtual hosts, around line 460, looks like this:
		# Virtual hosts
		Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
	c) uncomment cgi handler line around 406, like this:
		    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
		    
2) edit  /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf:  Modify the first <virtual host> directive to:

		<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
			DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents/"
			ServerName localhost
		</VirtualHost>

and then add this one:

	<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
		DocumentRoot "[PUT HERE MAINDIRPATH]"
		ServerName DataEnvironment
	
	<Directory [PUTH HERE MAIN DIRPATH]/>
		Options FollowSymLinks All MultiViews ExecCGI
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
	
	<Directory [PUT HERE MAINDIRPATH + /System/CGI-Executables] >
		Options FollowSymLinks All MultiViews ExecCGI
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
	
	</VirtualHost>

where MAINDIRPATH = the absolute path to your Data environment main directory.   

For example:

	<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
		DocumentRoot "/Users/danielyamins/DataEnvironment"
		ServerName DataEnvironment

	<Directory /Users/danielyamins/DataEnvironment/>
		Options FollowSymLinks All MultiViews ExecCGI
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
	
	<Directory /Users/danielyamins/DataEnvironment/System/CGI-Executables>
		Options FollowSymLinks All MultiViews ExecCGI
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
	
	</VirtualHost>
			
3) copy the additional virtual host from 2) into /private/etc/apache2/users/[USERNAME].conf

4) edit the file /private/etc/hosts and add the line 
	127.0.0.1 DataEnvironment 
	
5) turn on apache by going to System > Preferences> Sharing, then clicking to check "Web Sharing"



CYGWIN:

First, add an environmen variable in your Windows environment, with name 'CYGWIN' and value 'server'

Go to your Cygwin prompt.  

Now, try typing in:

>> cygserver-config

If you get something like "command not found" then you
need to run Cygwin setup, go to Admin and find cygserver. Install it.

Then go here:
http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-cygserver.html
and follow the directions which start at "How to
start Cygserver".

Then you just run:
>> cygserver-config

When it's finished, start the service :
>> net start cygserver

Then you should be able to start Apache with:
>> /usr/sbin/apachectl2 start


Now, to configure it for use in the DataEnvironment:

1) edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:
	a) change User to account USERNAME, around line 141
	b) uncomment line about including virtual hosts, around line 460, looks like this:
		# Virtual hosts
		Include /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
	c) uncomment cgi handler line around 406, like this:
		    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
		    
2) edit  /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf:  Modify the first <virtual host> directive to:

		<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
			DocumentRoot "/srv/www/htdocs"
			ServerName localhost
		</VirtualHost>

and then add this one:
	<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
		DocumentRoot "[intended directory]"
		ServerName [INTENDEDNAME]
	
	<Directory [intended directory]/>
		Options FollowSymLinks All MultiViews ExecCGI
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
	
	<Directory [intended directory for CGI scripts]>
		Options FollowSymLinks All MultiViews ExecCGI
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
	
	</VirtualHost>

4) add the line 127.0.0.1 [INTENDEDNAME] in /etc/hosts

5) turn on apache2 (by /usr/sbin/apachectl2 start) or restart if it's already started ( '/usr/sbin/apachectl2 stop' then '/usr/sbin/apachectl2 start')
