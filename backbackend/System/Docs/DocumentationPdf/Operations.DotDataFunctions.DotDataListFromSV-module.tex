\begin{alltt}
Takes a tabular file with the specified delimeter and end-of-line character,
and returns a list of columns (i.e. each list item is a list of data in one column, 
converted to native Python types) and a list of column names (column headers).

These two are returned as [attributes\_list, attribute\_names].

Parameters:

    Path - filename
    Delimiter - if given, the column separator in the file (if not given, automatically inferred from file extension)
    LineBreak - if given, the line separator in the file (defaults to newline)
    Header - whether the first line of the file is a header line
    SVHash - whether we expect one or more hash-lines (comment lines starting
    with a hash) at top of file.
       If both Header and SVHash are True, then we assume the header line also 
       begins with a hash,
       and is the last line beginning with a hash.
    ToLoad - list of attribute names (column names) to load.   each name in this 
    list must match the name
       of a column in the file (and you must also have Header == True )
    SkipFirstLines - this many first lines of the file will be ignored
