#This is a configuration file for the system.  Each of the lines in this file is a regular expression used to filter the LinkList to determine which links to
#automatically include in updates.   The regular expressions are filtering the python dotpath of the functionnames of the scripts that you want to run.  
#Lines beginning with a hash mark (like this one) will be ignored. 
#See documentation for the function System.LinkManagement.FilterForAutomaticUpdates for more information.
