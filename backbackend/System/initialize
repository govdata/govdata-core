'''
this is a script that initializes the data environment for exploratory user use.  E.g -- It is meant to be run by the user at the beginning of any interactive python interpreter session where you want to use Data Environment tools.  It is meant to be configured for each instance of a Data Environment.   Most of the contains of this particular example of the initializer is my personal settings, things that I find convenient.
